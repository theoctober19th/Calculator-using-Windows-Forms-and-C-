# Scientific Calculator
A simple calculator application using C#.NET and Windows Forms.

This a program I wrote when learning C#.NET and Visual Studio in college. All of the code was done from scratch. The calculator does basic algebraic operations plus the common scientific operations.

This also happens to be very first the GitHub repo I ever created.
